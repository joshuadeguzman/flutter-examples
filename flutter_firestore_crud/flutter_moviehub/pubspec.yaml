# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/moviehub.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: FontDefault
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/FontDefaultBold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/FontDefaultRegular.otf
    - family: Raleway
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Thin.ttf
          weight: 300
    - family: OpenSans
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Light.ttf
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages
